# Rain Ambient Audio File

**IMPORTANT**: The current `rain-ambient.mp3` file is a minimal placeholder for testing purposes.

To enable the full ambient rain sound feature with actual rain sounds, replace this file with a proper rain sound audio file.

You can download a rain sound from:
- https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/search/rain/
- https://freesound.org/search/?q=rain
- Any other royalty-free sound library

The file should be:
- **Format**: MP3
- **Name**: rain-ambient.mp3 (replace the existing file)
- **Loopable**: No harsh start/end transitions for seamless looping
- **Duration**: 30 seconds or longer recommended
- **Quality**: Good quality rain sound for ambient background

If no local file is available, the app will attempt to load from the CDN as a fallback.
