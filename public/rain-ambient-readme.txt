# Rain Ambient Audio File

To enable the ambient rain sound feature, place an MP3 file named "rain-ambient.mp3" in this directory.

You can download a rain sound from:
- https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/search/rain/
- https://freesound.org/search/?q=rain
- Any other royalty-free sound library

The file should be:
- Format: MP3
- Name: rain-ambient.mp3
- Loopable (no harsh start/end transitions)
- Duration: 30 seconds or longer recommended

Alternatively, the app will attempt to load from the CDN as a fallback.
